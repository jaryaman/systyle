### A word on virtual environments
We strongly recommend that every new project you work on has an associated virtual environment, so that package installation does not affect your operating system.

We favour the use of python virtual environments over Conda. See [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) for instructions on how to set up a python virtual environment.

### A word on IDEs
Consider using PyCharm.

## Demonstrations
See `./demos`.
