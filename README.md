### A word on virtual environments
We strongly recommend that every new project you work on has an associated virtual environment, so that package installation does not affect your operating system.

See [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for instructions on how to set up a conda environment.

You may need to install some fonts
```commandline
conda install -c conda-forge -y mscorefonts
rm ~/.cache/matplotlib -rf
```

### A word on IDEs
Consider using PyCharm.

## Demonstrations
See `./demos`.
